# BSF-Jacobi
Parallel implementation of the Jacobi method using the BSF-skeleton
This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the iterative Jacobi method for solving systems of linear algebraic equations on computing clusters. The solution is built using a BSF skeleton in C++. The source codes of the BSF skeleton with the user guide are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.
